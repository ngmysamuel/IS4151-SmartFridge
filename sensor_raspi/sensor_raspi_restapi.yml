  description: "This is the Swagger for Sensor Raspberry Pi
    Similar to Assignment 2, there will be a rhub.py running in the
    Rpi that will parse and read the serial / radio messages from the
    microbit / bosch sensor. Rhub.py will internally update SQLite DB.
    The cloud will call the GET methods.
    methods each for
    TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY and DOOR_STATUS.
    3 files backing up the API:
      sensor_raspi_temperature.py,
      sensor.py (for the website), 
      sensor_raspi_door.py.
    Each method in the file will have the same name as its path. "
